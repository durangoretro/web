# Assembly guide (computer)

## [Building options](computer/options.md)

_Whithin the same board_, you may choose from several building options:

- Supported video modes:
	- Colour only (_Durango路**S**_)
	- HIRES only (_Durango路**R**_)
	- **Both modes** (_Durango路**X**_, recommended option)
- Monitor output:
	- **SCART** (colour via _RGB_, recommended option)
	- Sync-on-green (v1) / Component video (v2+)
- Composite encoding:
	- Greyscale (standard in v1)
	- **Luminance** (standard in v2+, recommended option)

There are some _independent_ options as well, you may add them as desired:

- Second audio/video output
- PAL encoder (for composite output, _NOT_ recommended)
- Piezo buzzer for audio

## [BOM](computer/bom.md)

**Before** you begin soldering, please _make sure you've got both the **PCB** and **ALL of the components**_ needed, and that _they fit the footprints on the PCB_. Depending on the [chosen configuration](computer/options.md), some components may vary. In some cases, values are not mandatory and _might be changed_ to fit your stock.

## [Step by step](computer/steps.md)

!!! warning

	***This is a particularly complex project*** so it's assumed you've got _some experience_ soldering electronic circuits.

First of all, please read the [general advice](general.md) suitable for all of the boards. But **before soldering**, have into account
this particular board's peculiarities:

- ***IOx*** and _**Expansion** (sidecar)_ connectors **must be placed ABSOLUTELY FLUSH to the board**, otherwise fitting peripherals may become difficult or right impossible!
- Some _video output options_ are **compatible** and may be installed simultaneously, but some others have _overlapping footprints_ and aren't. Other than that, **all** the components can be fitted to the board without any problems, no matter the selected configuration.
- If you plan to use the suggested [keyboard/gamepads interface board](keyboard.md), **do NOT solder `D6` and `D4` _yet_** (`POWER` and `ERROR` LEDs) as they must be set at the _proper height_ in order to be visible over the keyboard PCB.

!!! bug

	v2 and v2.1 PCBs have a design bug which displays the picture heavily _shifted to the left of the screen_ (although the whole area stays visible). Check the [hacks and fixes section](computer/steps.md) for an easy mod to fix this.
	**v2.2 and later are NOT affected** by this bug, as wasn't v1.

## [Troubleshooting](computer/troubleshoot.md)

Not working? Don't panic!
