# General advice for assembly

!!! warning

	This a **VERY COMPLEX** project (especially the _computer_ board, now with **over 1000 pads** to be soldered). This is **NOT** an ideal project to learn soldering techniques! You've been warned...
	In any case, **take your time**, read throughfully all the directions FIRST, then start building step-by-step as indicated -- and be **patient**!.

!!! danger

	**Soldering** is a risky activity! From **severe burns** to **toxic fumes inhalation** and MANY other hazards! _Make sure you follow **ALL of the Safety Advice** stated on this document_ BEFORE attempting any soldering!

## Tools and materials

-	Obviously, you'll need a **soldering iron**. Doesn't need to be a fancy one, but you'll definitely need a **very fine point** -- some people prefer the _chisel-shaped_ ones. **Temperature regulation** is not essential, but might be helpful -- some pads are connected to broad _ground planes_, which do "stole" quite a bit of heat from the iron. In case a _fixed power_ iron is used, anything between **11 and 30 Watts** seems suitable.
-	About **solder (tin)** itself, since these are very _dense_ boards, **fine (~0.5 mm) solder wire** is recommended; however, thicker wire **(~1 mm)** may be useful for bigger joints (connectors etc). _Depending on your local regulations and health concerns_, you might use **leaded or lead-free** solder; the latter will need somewhat _higher temperatures_ and may require some extra experience (this is NOT a project for newbies, anyway). _Most solder wire nowadays include a **flux** core for easier soldering_.
	-	If **leaded solder** is to be used, make certain proper **safety procedures** are used: the use of **gloves** is recommended and, of course, do **wash** your hands throughly after a soldering session.
-	_In any case_, **avoid inhaling fumes** (actually from the _flux_ core inside most soldering wires) by working in a **well ventilated area** or using a suitable [**fume extractor**](https://www.amazon.com/Extractor-Absorber-Portable-Filter-Soldering-Fan-Extraction-Prevention/dp/B099ZN8TRJ/)! _This is a MUCH bigger concern than the use of leaded solder_, by the way.
-	[**Flux**]() is not essential, but sometimes helpful as it cleans the soldering surfaces. _**Fumes are harmful**, thus check the _ventilation_ advice above.
-	On projects of such complexity, _errors_ are to be expected... Some way to **desolder** components is really helpful:
	-	A [**desoldering pump**](https://www.amazon.com/Weller-7874B-ESD-Safe-Desoldering-Aluminum/dp/B00DKYNKPK) is a cheap and relatively efficient way for casual desoldering.
 	-	A [**desoldering iron**](https://www.amazon.com/RadioShack-45-Watt-Desoldering-Iron/dp/B007Z7MNEM/) combines a regular iron with a (usually bulb-operated) pump, for convenience.
	-	[**Solder wick**](https://www.amazon.com/MG-Chemicals-limpieza-Desoldering-longitud/dp/B008O9WMNM/) is somewhat slower, but usually gives the best finish. _Adding liquid flux to the braid may improve performance_, especially when using lower-priced wicks.
	-	For _higher volume_ and **utmost convenience**, a [**desoldering station**]() is best -- at a price.
