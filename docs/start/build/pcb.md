# PCB manufacturing

***(under construction)***

Get the Gerber files (in a `.zip` package) from the desired board
and send them to [JLC PCB](https://jlcpcb.com).

Alternatively, if you want to use any other PCB manufacturer, or customise the board in some way:

1. Open the design files in [KiCAD 5.x](https://www.kicad.org)
1. Edit the [_Pcbnew_](https://www.kicad.org/discover/pcb-design/) file if desired
1. Generate the [Gerber files](https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/10-How-to-generate-Gerber-and-Drill-files-in-KiCad-5) _according to your manufacturer instructions_
1. [Order your PCBs](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote/) _from your favourite manufacturer_ via the Gerber files
