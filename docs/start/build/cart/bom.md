# Bill Of Materials 
Once you get the Development Cartridge (ShadowRAM) PCB, it's time to gather all the necessary **components**. _Make sure you pick up all the component for a particular configuration_; some components differs due to the chose options and the desired configuration.

!!! note

	Assume all ICs are in DIP package, resistors are rated **1/4 W** and capacitors **10 V** or higher, _unless noted otherwise_.
