# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Here you can find some questions about the Durango Project and all the projects related with it.

### What is Durango?

Durango is an Open Hardware and Open Source project, lead by the [Durango Computer Team](about.md),
intended for learning how to create a [Home Computer using the 6502 microprocessor](hard/arch.md).
With this project you can [build a computer](start/building.md) from scratch,
[creating the minimum software base](tools.md) and even a [gaming](soft/games.md) platform.

### How I can get a Durango Computer?

You can [build a Durango Computer](start/build/durango.md) getting the [PCBs](start/build/pcb.md)
made and all the components, as you can see in the [Getting Started Page](started.md).
You can find information about [Hardware](hardware.md) and [Software](software.md)
in this Web site as well.

### Can I purchase a Durango Computer?

No. Currently it's in development stage and there is no plan to sell any Durango Computers.
You can build your own Durango from the supplied design, anyway.

### Do I need a Durango Computer in order to develop for this platform?

No. We provide [Development Tools](dev/tools.md) to create and run your own Durango Software,
like an [emulator](start/run/emulation.md), a [C Library](dev/lang/durangolib.md)
and even a Docker Image containing all the tools for development.

### Can I contribute for this Project?

This is an Open Hardware and Open Source project. You can find the source code of
all of our Project in our [Github Organization](https://github.com/durangoretro/).
