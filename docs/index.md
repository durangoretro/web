Of course, there is more; we are trying to create all the tools, software and libraries needed to develop new software using modern tools like Docker images or creating user friendly libraries.

This project is made with the collaboration of [La Jaquería](https://lajaqueria.org). _Also, a big shout out to [Sam Falvo](https://github.com/sam-falvo), [BigEd](https://github.com/BigEd), [André Fachat](http://6502.org/users/andre/index.html), [Garth Wilson](http://wilsonmines.com/), [Michal Kowalski](https://sbc.rictor.org/kowalski.html), the late [Lee Davidson](http://web.archive.org/web/20130308145900/http://mycorner.no-ip.org/6502/ehbasic/index.html) and all the nice folks at [6502.org](http://6502.org/) for their friendly help, support and inspiration!_
