# Durango Retro Computer

**A retro-inspired architecture**

Welcome to the Durango Computer Web Page.

Durango is an Open Source and Open hardware project to create a
[retro computer system](hard/arch.md),
using the **65C02** microprocessor and **standard _74-series_ logic chips**.
From the creation of all the [hardware](hardware.md) architecture, to all the
tools and information to create a new [Development System](tools.md) for this computer.

In this web page you can find all the information about this project; from
[building a brand new Durango·X computer](start/building.md), to the [Software](software.md) and tools wrote to develop new programs and [games](soft/games.md) for this computer.

Of course, there is more; we are trying to create all the tools, software and
libraries needed to develop new software using modern tools like Docker images or creating
[user friendly libraries](dev/lang/durangolib.md). Or you may just
[enjoy the already made Durango software](start/running.md),
with or without an actual Durango computer!
