# Precursors

Before the birth of ***Durango·X***, several other attempts were made,
with varying degrees of success.

## _SDd / Chihuahua_

Originally standing for _Didactic Development System_, was a simple **1 MHz CPU 65C02 + VIA 6522**
computer on a breadboard, intended to teach _Hardware Fundamentals_ in the vocational school.
_Not all address pins were conected_, thus limited to **4 KiB ROM and 2 KiB RAM**.

Actually _my first **working** 6502 design_.

***Chihuahua*** was essentially the same design on a compact _protoboard_, but there was some
**strange bug** that prevented proper communication between CPU and VIA. An improved
***Chihuahua PLUS*** with _full addressing range_ was started, but never finished.

There is a [revival](https://github.com/zuiko21/minimOS/tree/master/hard/kicad/chihuahua)
of the _Chihuahua_ concept with some interfaces from the **Durango·X** computer.

## Durango-*PROTO*

_The original **Durango** incarnation_ intended as a CPU tester, then an external **VDU**
was added thru a preliminary [IOx bus](bus/iox.md). Originally a **1 MHz, 32 KiB RAM, 16 KiB ROM** system,
soon was expanded to **32 KiB ROM** with the familiar _128-byte I/O area_. The external
VDU was **monochrome, 128 x 128 pixels**.
