# Keyboard/Gamepad Interface v1.0 fix

## For Mega Drive version ONLY

While the _NES flavour_ of the [Keyboard/Gamepad Interface board](keyboard.md) works flawlessly, a **bug** is present on the **MD version** _v1.0_ revision of this board. Please use the _workaround_ described below:

!!! warning

	This workaround is for the **Mega Drive** version of the Interface; do **NOT** apply these mods to the _NES_ version.

* Disconnect **pin 11 of U9** in the Interface board (either _bending_ or _cutting_ the IC's leg, or by _removing_ the corresponding _socket pin_ -- **this pin should be NOT in contact with the board**.
* On the _back_ of the board, make a bridge between **pins 11 and 12 of U9**, as shown on the pictures below.

!!! bug

	This fix allows operation of a MD controller pad, although `C` and `START` buttons will be swapped.

!!! note

	All of these issues are already **fixed** on revision _v1.3_ or later.
