# About the Durango Project

Durango is a project developed by [zuiko21](https://twitter.com/zuiko21/),
with the help of [La Jaquer√≠a](https://lajaqueria.org), to create a computer
using the 6502 microprocessor with its own architecture.

This is an Open Hardware and Open Source Software Project. You can find all our
projects in our [Github Organization](https://github.com/durangoretro/).

## Durango Computer Team

The Durango Computer Team is the people behind the project, working together to
design and implement the [hardware](hardware.md) and [software](software.md) for Durango.

Of course [everyone can become part of the Durango Computer Team](community.md),
thanks to the open Hardware and Open Source initiative. Here you can find the
core people of the Durango Computer Team:
