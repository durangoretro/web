# Future Projects

Here You can find Information about Future projects that can be in development in the future. You can find new features or revisions of the Durango Computer Project.

## Durango Imager

If you are going to use the Durango Development Cartridge, you can use this application to select all the Durango Roms, generate an image, and flash to the SDCard.

!!! warning
    This Project is under design stage, the current features, can be changed in the future.

## VeraCruz
 A quantum leap above the 8-bit, 6502-based Durango home computers. The use of the advanced 65C816 CPU will allow full compatibility of well-behaved minimOS applications, but also the availability of a much larger address space and higher speed (especially with 16-bit math).

The ultimate goal is to reach the 3M benchmark (1 MiB of memory, 1 Mpixel on screen, 1 MIPS). The current Veracruz model lacks only the "second M", topping at ~0.25 Mpixel (512x512).

* **Veracruz**: the entry-level 5 MHz 65C816 workstation
* **SIXtationÂ·P**: ~7 MHz portrait display workstation[^1]
* **Jalisco**: 9 MHz 65C816 workstation with 1360 x 768 px. colour display[^2]
* **Tabasco**: Top of the range 13.5 MHz 65C816 workstation with high resolution colour display[^2]

!!! info
    This Project is under construction; is only in design and definition stage and is not ready yet.

### Veracruz Basic Specs

* CPU: 65C816 @ 5 MHz
* ROM: 32 KiB built in firmware plus extended cartridge slot up to 1 MiB

* Use of some dedicated chips (65C22 VIAs, 6445 CRTC, PLDs...) for reduced chip count
* Video output: via SVGA monitor
* Other ports to be determined

### Video Modes
